# Home Lockdown Framework

## Purpose and scope

Our aim is to provide comprehensive and clear guidance regarding expectations, purpose, and implementation of a home lockdown protocol suitable during the COVID-19 viral outbreak. The aim is to, as much as possible, keep you, your family and household, and all your neighbors and fellow humans safe and well. At the same time, we hope to provide clear instructions and context to reduce anxiety and make this difficult situation a little bit easier.

## Overview

The home lockdown framework is designed to provide clear guidance on the essential reasons for, expectations in, and how to implement a home lockdown protocol. Because this is intended as a guide for "the majority of people in the rich world", we attempt to provide guidance on what to do and how to use this framework for individual situations while providing specific and clear instructions.

To understand the reasons behind and goals of the lockdown, please refer to the [Home Lockdown Policy](policies/Home%20Lockdown%20Policy.md) document. The standards document provide a clear enumeration on expectations. The procedures documents provide step-by-step instructions on how to implement a home lockdown.
