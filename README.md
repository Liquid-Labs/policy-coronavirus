# Coronavirus Household Policy

How much should you do? How much is too much? The Coronavirus Household Policy answers these questions with clear instructions that are updated regularly to follow current best practices and guidance. Whether you're an office worker working from home with occasional outings or a front-line worker with high on-the-job exposure, these policies have you covered.

Start with the [Home Lockdown Framework](./policy/families/Home%20Lockdown%20Framework.md).
