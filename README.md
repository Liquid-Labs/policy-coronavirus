# Coronavirus Household Policy

<span style="color: red">We are currently working on completing the first draft of this policy.</span> You are welcome to read what we have so far, [open issues](./issues/new) where you see problems, and let us know what's missing and how we can improve. Just be aware that this is currently a work in progress.

How much should you do? How much is too much? The Coronavirus Household Policy answers these questions with clear instructions that are updated regularly to follow current best practices and guidance. Whether you're an office worker working from home with occasional outings or a front-line worker with high on-the-job exposure, these policies have you covered.

Start with the [Home Lockdown Framework](./policy/families/Home%20Lockdown%20Framework.md).
